Blog Entry # 1						     Date: 12/6/19


Today I made 4 files to put information about Artificial Intelligence. (Where are you at in the process of your product? See hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp)

I learned that ide.cs.50.io could desgin some websites.  (What are you learning in class that applies directly to your project? How will you use the synthesis practice we did today on your project?)

I used github.com and ide.cs.50.io. (What sources did you use to learn that? Some days this will just be class instruction.)

A skill that I used was creativity to design the file. How are you developing in ways that apply outside of your project? See hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills
